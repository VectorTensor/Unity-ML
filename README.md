# Machine Learning Model for unity

## Vector Operations
Some Basic vector/Matrix operations were also implemented [Utils](https://github.com/VectorTensor/Unity-ML/tree/main/Assets/Scripts/Utils).
It has two different classes Vector and Tensor. Vector is used for vector operations and Tensor for matrix calculations.
You can perform operations using standard operators like +, - ,* etc.
